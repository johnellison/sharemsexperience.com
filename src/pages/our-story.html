          We started a grassroots recycling <a href="https://vimeo.com/28415093">initiative in Egypt</a> and helped <a href="http://facebook.com/projectdehradun">design and build classrooms</a> for children with special needs in India. It was there in India where Sophie caught Tyhoid. It began our three-year-long journey of chronic illness. After seeing dozens of traditional doctors, being prescribed several courses of antibiotics&mdash;her health just kept getting worse. Having seen my mother struggle with <abbr title="multiple scleurosis">MS</abbr> my entire life, we wanted to do anything we could to reverse Sophie's decline in health...
        </p>

        <h2>Discovering Functional Medicine</h2>
        <p>A friend of ours from church heard about Sophie's symptoms and told us about <a href="https://www.functionalmedicine.org/about/whatisfm/">Functional Medicine</a>&mdash;an evidence-based approach to dealing with chronic disease, saying:</p>

        <aside class="pull-quote">
          <blockquote>
            <p>Functional medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs of the 21st century.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </aside>

        <h3>Functional Medicine Meets MS</h3>

        <p>
          Within three weeks of her first appointment, Sophie began to show significant signs of recovery for the first time since her illness. Soon thereafter another friend approached us about a woman named <a href="http://terrywahls.com/">Dr. Terry Wahls</a> who had reversed the effects of her own MS through functional medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mother has suffered from MS for almost thirty years, and so while initially very skeptical, we were encouraged by the results Sophie was experiencing and decided to watch <a href="
          http://terrywahls.com/tedxiowacity-minding-your-mitochondria-with-dr-terry-wahls/">Dr. Wahl tell her story</a>. What she claimed was remarkable. Even more so, it made sense.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traditional medicine often treats autoimmune conditions by supressing the immune system. They sometimes neglect to consider what is <em>causing</em> the immune system to attack itself in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functional Medicine advocates for patients to use empirical evidence to:

           <ul>
             <li>Discover what was triggering the immune system to attack</li>
             <li>Remove those triggers</li>
             <li>Support the body's cellular function through high-nutrient  whole foods</li>
             <li>Support the body's natural healing through physical therapy and rehabilitation</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Starting The Wahls Protocol</h3>
        <p>
          Sophie and I along with a handful of family and friends decided to band together to help my mom get started on what Dr. Wahls calls <a href="http://terrywahls.com/about-the-wahls-protocol/">The Wahls Protocol</a>. We created <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M8soAIyvc1ol1ikr7X6-mb5paVPIuatD3GtDMb8wlF4/pubhtml">a meal plan and rotor</a>, and set off to the grocery store to buy the ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first the results were frustrating. Eating according to a special protocol tends to conjure up lots of mixed emotions, and it was no different for our family. My mom experienced a lot of detox symptoms for the first few months, but to her credit she stuck to the diet with a powerful determination to get better.
        </p>
        <h3>Experiencing Results</h3>
        <p>
          Now almost two years later, my mother has finally begun to experience small and tangible recoveries:
        </p>
        <aside class="pull-quote">
          <blockquote>
            <p>I have more energy, I'm sleeping better, I recover more quickly from outings and I feel better than I have in years...</p>
            <span>&mdash; Sarah Ellison</span>
          </blockquote>
        </aside>

        <p>
          My father, who just like us was a bit skeptical at first, has come to fully embrace the protocol&mdash;organic food and all. We haven't experienced miraculous recovies like Terry Wahls, but we've witness incremental improvement and in the context of chronic progressive disease those are worth everything.

        <h3>Dreaming of A Retreat Centre For MS</h3>

        <p>
          After moving to the UK and taking <a href="http://writings.john-ellison.com/my-migration-from-digital-life/">a step back from working in digital</a>, we spent some time dreaming about what would come next in regards to our vocation. A few workshops later, we seemed at a loss for a good fit that would take us forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then one night in Scotland the idea came to us as we sat down for dinner:
        </p>
        <aside class="pull-quote">
          <blockquote>
            <p>What if we created a retreat centre for people with MS and could help them get started on The Wahls Protocol like we did with my mom?</p>
          </blockquote>
        </aside>

        <p>
          It was clear to both of us that this idea held a huge amount of gravity. It fulfilled our desire for a social purpose and a spiritual mission. It could allow us to live on the land and be stewards of it as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          But neither of us had experience in the medical world nor in hospitality. So it was a big leap forward to say the least. Day after day the idea maintained its prominence in our minds and we've both committed to seeing the retreat centre come to life. It's just about finding a way to make it work.
        </p>


        <p>
          This website is part of our process of trying to make this dream work. We wanted to create something that would allow us to share our vision and engage with the people we hope to serve. We'll be hosting events to test out different elements of the retreat and hopefully we'll have a retreat scheduled before long.
