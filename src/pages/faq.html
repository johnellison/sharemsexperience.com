          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <h4 class="subheader">We've compilied a list of answers to questions that we are often asked by people interested in our study.</h4>
        </hgroup>
        <h4>Q: What kind of questions are you going to ask?</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> Since we review each application individually, the questions we ask in the discussion can vary, but here are some common ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How have you approached treating your MS since diagnosis?</li>
          <li>What does a typical day look like for you?</li>
          <li>What do you need that isnâ€™t currently being provided by existing practitioners, charities, etc.?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Q: What are you going to do with the information I provide?</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>A:</strong> Firstly, anything you share with us is 100% confidential and secure. We will never share your information with anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, here's a step by step of what we do with the information. First, we'll ask for your permission to record the audio of the discussion for future reference. (Taking notes at the pace someone speaks can be very difficult and it's easy to miss things.)
        </p>
        <p>
          If we receive your permission, we'll store recordings on a industry-grade secure server that is protected by two-factor authentication and is only accessible by people within our team.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then review the information you provided and look for insights and discuss them with our team. We'll reference other sources of information and try to find patterns that indicate ways we could help serve people with MS in the future.
