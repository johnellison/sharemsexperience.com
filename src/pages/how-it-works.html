                You fill out a secure 3-5 minute application to tell us a bit about yourself and indicate how you'd like to share your experience:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>A)</strong> In person (at a public location)
                </p>
              <p>

              We get in touch to talk about next steps and put a date in the diary to hear about your experience.

              You will have a discussion with John or Sophie about your experiences.

            <p>
              Everything you share is 100% confidential and private. You can stop the discussion at any time.
